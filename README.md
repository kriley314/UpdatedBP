# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This version of the portfolio is my ltest version.  I had already turned in the Bootstrap 
version but did not like how the text was wrapped in the initial screen.  SO..  I created
a new version to try making the text look better.  It came out in a way I liked so..  I 
went ahead and created this repository.

Latest change is to get rid of my vacation pictures and instead put in images from the
Crystal Game and the Trivial Trivia project.  I incorporated those images and then altered
the action for the images to make them links to actually start up instances of the apps
in a new tab!!
